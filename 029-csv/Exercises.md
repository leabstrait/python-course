##### Write a script “high_scores.py” that will read in a CSV file of users' scores and display the highest score for each person. The file you will read in is named “scores.csv” and is located in the chapter 7 practice files folder. You should store the high scores as values in a dictionary with the associated names as dictionary keys. This way, as you read in each row of data, if the name already has a score associated with it in the dictionary, you can compare these two scores and decide whether or not to replace the “current” high score in the dictionary.

Use the sorted() function on the dictionary's keys in order to display an ordered list of high scores,
