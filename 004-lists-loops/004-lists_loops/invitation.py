"""Ask the user to enter the names of three people they want to
invite to a party and store them in a list. After they have entered
all three names, ask them if they want to add another. If they do,
allow them to add more names until they answer “no”. When
they answer “no”, display how many people they have invited to
the party.

"""
Change the above program so that once the user has completed their list of names, display the
full list and ask them to type in one of the names on the list. Display the position of that
name in the list. Ask the user if they still want that person to come to the party. If they
answer “no”, delete that entry from the list and display the list again.
