- Create a 3 x 3 NumPy array named firstMatrix that includes the numbers 3 through 11 by using arange() and reshape()
- Display the minimum, maximum and mean of all entries in firstMatrix
- Square every entry in firstMatrix using the ** operator, and save the results in an array named secondMatrix
- Use vstack() to stack firstMatrix on top of secondMatrix and save the results in an array named thirdMatrix
- Use dot() to calculate the dot product of thirdMatrix by firstMatrix
- Reshape thirdMatrix into an array of dimensions 3 x 3 x 2


- Try drawing a sine, cosine plot
- read some csv data and plot it
